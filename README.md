    - By day of the week
    - By product category
- **Revenue:**
    - By month
- **Summary:**

### Tech-stack + Libraries

- Excel
- Pivot Tables & Dashboard

### Initial Insights

- Lower Manhattan makes less than €150 from 7pm to 8pm, and should consider closing shop at that time
- Hell's kitchen is the only shop to open at 6am but they make less than €1700 during that first hour. They also make less than €550 during it's final hour at 8pm, and should consider adjusting their opening hours
- Hot chocolate at the Astoria location is particularly profitable, generating more revenue per sale than other items so you should consider adjusting marketing efforts.
